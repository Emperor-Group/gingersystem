Redefining the forums as we know them. This is a brand new system for dynamic forums made to potentiate collective intelligence in organizations. Our goal is for everybody in an organization to be in sync and have a grand, unified vision of what the current state is, and what must be achieved to be better. Greater than forums, we aim to apply the basic principles of the science behind collective intelligence in order to trully potentiate what groups of people are able to do, if they work together.
